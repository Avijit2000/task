## Task 2. Select Security Objectives

For our network design scenario, here are the selected sub-categories from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and their explanations:

### 1. **Function: Protect**  
   **Category: PR.AC (Access Control)**  
   **Sub-category: PR.AC-1**  
   **Description:** "Identities and credentials are managed for users, devices, and processes."  
   **Importance:** Proper management of identities and credentials ensures that only authorized individuals and devices can access specific network resources. In a network with multiple routers and features like wireless access and CCTV monitoring, managing credentials helps prevent unauthorized access to critical systems and data.  
   **Mitigates:** Vulnerabilities associated with unauthorized access and insider threats. For instance, it helps protect against attacks where an unauthorized user gains access to sensitive data or controls system functions improperly.

### 2. **Function: Protect**  
   **Category: PR.DS (Data Security)**  
   **Sub-category: PR.DS-5**  
   **Description:** "Data integrity is maintained and protected."  
   **Importance:** Ensuring data integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized alteration or corruption, which is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of information across your network. In departments handling sensitive data, such as labs and resource centers, data integrity is vital for operational reliability and trust.  
   **Mitigates:** Risks associated with data corruption or tampering, such as attacks that involve altering critical data to disrupt operations or mislead users.

### 3. **Function: Detect**  
   **Category: DE.AE (Anomalies and Events)**  
   **Sub-category: DE.AE-2**  
   **Description:** "Anomalous activity is detected and analyzed."  
   **Importance:** Detecting and analyzing anomalies in network activity helps identify potential security incidents early. In a network with multiple departments and features like RFID systems and digital notice boards, early detection of unusual behavior is crucial to preventing or mitigating security breaches.  
   **Mitigates:** Risks of undetected security incidents, such as insider threats or external attacks that could exploit system vulnerabilities before being noticed.

### 4. **Function: Detect**  
   **Category: DE.CM (Continuous Monitoring)**  
   **Sub-category: DE.CM-8**  
   **Description:** "Monitoring for unauthorized personnel, connections, devices, and software is performed."  
   **Importance:** Continuously monitoring the network for unauthorized personnel, connections, and devices ensures that any attempts to introduce rogue elements or unauthorized access are promptly detected. This is particularly important in a complex network setup with various routers and connected devices.  
   **Mitigates:** Risks associated with unauthorized access and potential breaches caused by rogue devices or unauthorized software, which could compromise network security and functionality.

### Summary for Journal:

1. **PR.AC-1: Identities and credentials are managed for users, devices, and processes.**  
   **Importance:** Ensures only authorized access to network resources, protecting against unauthorized access and insider threats.  
   **Mitigates:** Unauthorized access and insider threats.

2. **PR.DS-5: Data integrity is maintained and protected.**  
   **Importance:** Protects data from unauthorized alteration, ensuring accuracy and reliability.  
   **Mitigates:** Data corruption and tampering.

3. **DE.AE-2: Anomalous activity is detected and analyzed.**  
   **Importance:** Helps in identifying and responding to potential security incidents early.  
   **Mitigates:** Undetected security incidents and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

4. **DE.CM-8: Monitoring for unauthorized personnel, connections, devices, and software is performed.**  
   **Importance:** Detects and addresses unauthorized access or rogue devices, maintaining network security.  
   **Mitigates:** Unauthorized access and breaches from rogue devices or software.

By implementing these sub-categories, you can enhance your networkâ€™s protection and detection capabilities, ensuring a robust security posture for your organization.

## Task 4. Conduct a Risk Analysis

To conduct a risk analysis for your network design project, you can use a risk assessment template to identify potential risks, evaluate their impact, and determine appropriate mitigation strategies. Here's a general approach to performing a risk analysis, which you can follow when filling out your risk assessment template spreadsheet:

### 1. **Identify Assets and Threats**

First, list all critical assets in your network design, which may include:

- Firewall
- Core Router
- Backup Core Router
- Distribution Routers (1, 2, 3)
- CCTV Cameras
- Digital Notice Board
- Employee Login Credentials
- Network Hardware
- Printing Services
- Wireless Access Points
- Data Backup Systems

Next, identify potential threats to these assets. Common threats might include:

- Unauthorized access
- Hardware failure
- Network attacks (e.g., DDoS, malware)
- Data breaches
- Physical damage (e.g., fire, flood)
- Human error

### 2. **Assess Risks**

For each asset-threat combination, evaluate the following:

1. **Likelihood:** How probable is it that the threat will exploit the vulnerability? This can be categorized as Low, Medium, or High.
2. **Impact:** If the threat materializes, what will be the impact on the asset? This can also be categorized as Low, Medium, or High.
3. **Risk Level:** Combine likelihood and impact to determine the overall risk level. This can be categorized as Low, Medium, or High.

### 3. **Determine Mitigation Strategies**

For each identified risk, propose mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. Mitigation strategies may include:

- Implementing additional security controls (e.g., intrusion detection systems)
- Regularly updating and patching systems
- Performing regular backups and testing restoration procedures
- Conducting staff training on security best practices
- Ensuring physical security measures (e.g., access controls, fire suppression systems)

### 4. **Document the Risk Assessment**

Use the following template format to document your risk assessment in the spreadsheet:

| **Asset**                 | **Threat**             | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Risk Level** | **Mitigation Strategy**                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Firewall                  | Unauthorized Access    | Medium         | High       | High           | Implement strong access controls and regular audits. |
| Core Router               | Hardware Failure       | Low            | High       | Medium         | Set up redundant hardware and regular maintenance. |
| Distribution Router 1     | Network Attack         | Medium         | Medium     | Medium         | Deploy firewall rules and IDS/IPS systems. |
| CCTV Cameras              | Physical Damage        | Low            | High       | Medium         | Use protective enclosures and install in secure locations. |
| Employee Login Credentials| Data Breach            | High           | High       | High           | Implement multi-factor authentication and strong password policies. |
| Digital Notice Board      | Data Integrity Issue   | Low            | Medium     | Low            | Regularly verify data accuracy and access controls. |


Regularly review and update the risk assessment as new threats emerge or as changes are made to the network design or operational procedures.

By systematically identifying assets, evaluating risks, and planning mitigations, you can effectively manage and reduce potential risks to your network design. This approach will help ensure that your network operates securely and efficiently.
