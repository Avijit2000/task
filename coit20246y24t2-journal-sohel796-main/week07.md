## Task 3: Use Wifi Access Point

Using Wifi access points for accessng the wireless services within the network. For doing so it needs to know the hardware or Router well. Here, for understanding the wifi access points and it's features i tried the provided simulation software as i don't have the access of my home or any other business routers.

From July 28 to September 8, 2024, I stands out as the most active contributor due to several key factors. we both made 23 commits, nearly double the 14 commits from the second most active contributor, shakir, and far more than the single commit by the bot. I added 780 lines of code compared to 178 by my group partner, indicating a significant role in developing new features or enhancements. Our contributions focus primarily on adding code (+780 lines) with minimal deletions (-4 lines), suggesting a focus on expanding the codebase rather than refining it. Consistent weekly contributions further demonstrate ongoing involvement and commitment.
